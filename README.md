# Overview
This project analyses which features and amounts my client should focus on when searching for a house in Washington given their overall budget. After an analysis of the 2015 King County House Sale dataset, I was able to supply my client with valuable information. The recommended features given were 2 bedroom houses, 1 bathroom houses, 1 floor level houses, or houses with no more than 100 square footage of living.
# Business Understanding
This is 2015 and I am an Data analysist. I was hired by my client to help determine house features that they should keep an eye out for when house searching. My client is searching for a home that is not older than 1965 while having a budget of $700,000. I will be using the 2015 King County House Sales dataset to estimate a combination of house features and amounts that fit within the given budget for homes in the Washington area. Some features that my client is interested in are bedrooms, bathrooms, square foot living, square foot above, square foot basement, square foot lot, floors, latitude, and longitude, and the house age. This dataset has houses that were built as far as 1900. My predictions are important because I am giving my client advice that is backed by data which will provide them with the best scenerios possible. My advice to my clients are more genuine than most since I am not trying to persaude anyone to by a house that may be overpriced.
# Data
This data is from 2015 King County House Sales dataset. This data relates to the data analysis question because is contains the prices these house were sold for and features. Some features within this dataset are bedrooms, bathrooms, square foot living, the year buit, etc. The target varible for these homes in Washington are the prices.
# Results
 After creating this final model, there turns out to be 61% variance in the house price. This model also had a condition numer of 7.62e+15. The overall model and individual features were statistically significant. The root mean square error was 225099.13, which is the standard deviation of the residuals. Even though there is high correlation between some features and a low correlation between house age and price, based on the R2 score this would be the finally model that would work best for the business problem
# Conclusion
This Data analysis leads to some recommendations that will allow my client to purchase a house in the Washington area, 47°N,-122°W, without going over budget.
- Look for houses with no more than 2 bedrooms
- Look for houses with 1 bathroom
- Look for houses with no more than 100 sqaure feet in living area
- Look for houses with only 1 floor level, No basement
# Next Steps
If I were to use this dataset for another client I would consider inluding more features, perhaps the zipcode, grade, and conditions
- The zipcode is used by the United States Postal Code
- The overall grade is related to the construction and design of the house
- The overall condition of the house is realted to the maintence
